# Contributing to the Blog

Thank you for helping build the blog — we welcome new posts, fixes, and improvements.

Where to add content
- Place posts in: `content/posts/`
- Place images/assets in: `content/assets/` and reference them with relative paths.

Filename and frontmatter
- Recommended filename format: `YYYY-MM-DD-your-title.md` or `your-slug.md`.
- Required frontmatter (YAML at the top of each post):
  ```
  ---
  title: "Post title"
  date: "2025-11-17"
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"]
  draft: false
  ---
  ```
- Use `draft: true` for posts you don’t want published yet.

How to preview locally (example for a Node/Next/Static site)
1. Clone the repo:
   - git clone git@github.com:ngoctramtpofficial/ngoctramtp.git
   - cd ngoctramtp
2. If the site is in a subfolder `site/`, go there:
   - cd site
3. Install and run:
   - npm install
   - npm run dev
4. Open http://localhost:3000 to preview.

If you’re using another stack (Hugo/Jekyll/Astro), use the normal commands for that framework (hugo server / bundle exec jekyll serve / npm run dev for Astro).

Pull request checklist

- [ ] Images are added to `content/assets/` and referenced relatively.
- [ ] No broken links in the post.
- [ ] Previewed locally or via PR preview.
- [ ] Set `draft: false` when ready to publish.
